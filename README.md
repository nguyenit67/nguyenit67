# Hi! 👋

I’m an AI major student, exploring fields like Computer Vision (CV), Natural Language Processing (NLP), General AI (GenAI), Machine Learning (ML), and Data Science. Currently, I’m delving into NLP, but I’m also keen on CV, Data Science, ML, Speech Processing, and developing software and solutions using AI and technology. Let’s connect and innovate together!

## 🏓 Interests

When I'm not coding, you can find me:
- Reading manga 📔
- Watching movies 📽️
- Listening to music 🎧
- Keeping up with the latest news on technology and AI 💻

## ✏️ Learning

I'm on a journey to learn more about AI and find the domain that suits me the most. I love the process of learning and growing, and I'm always open to new experiences and knowledge.

## 🤝 Collaboration

I'm eager to connect and collaborate with other enthusiasts who share a passion for AI and technology. I firmly believe in the power of collaboration and am excited to both learn from others and contribute to meaningful projects. In 2023, I had the oppoturnity to contribute to a project that involved donating gifts and school supplies to children in foster care and emergency shelters. If you’re interested, feel free to check it out and collaborate with them at [donategifts](https://github.com/donategifts/donategifts).
